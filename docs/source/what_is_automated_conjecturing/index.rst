What is Automated Conjecturing?
===============================

Automated conjecturing is the use of computational systems to propose new mathematical statements—especially inequalities, equalities, or structural characterizations—that appear to be true but are not yet proven. These systems serve as creative collaborators, exploring vast mathematical landscapes and uncovering patterns that spark human insight.

TxGraffiti belongs to this growing ecosystem of discovery tools. But unlike many past systems, it is designed to unify multiple paradigms of conjecture generation under a single programmable interface.

In this section, we explore the historical and conceptual foundations of automated conjecturing, highlighting major paradigms and connecting them to how TxGraffiti works.
