Welcome to TxGraffiti
=====================

*A machine that dreams in mathematics, scrawling conjectures on the walls of discovery.*

**TxGraffiti** is a Python toolkit for **automated mathematical conjecturing**.

It empowers machines to explore mathematical structure‚Äîuncovering patterns, generating inequalities, and proposing candidate theorems backed by data. TxGraffiti blends symbolic logic, optimization, and heuristics into a unified system capable of operating across graph theory, number theory, combinatorics, and more.

Originally prototyped in **2016**, TxGraffiti descends from a rich lineage of systems‚Äîfrom Fajtlowicz‚Äôs *Graffiti* and DeLaVi√±a‚Äôs *Graffiti.pc*, to Mel√≥t's *GraPHedron*‚Äîand has since powered dozens of research projects, produced open conjectures, and contributed to peer-reviewed theorems.

This modern version of *TxGraffiti* was designed and developed by **Randy Davila**, with contributions from **Jillian Eddy**, and introduces new capabilities for discovery and interaction:

- Symbolic logic for properties, predicates, and conjectures
- Linear and geometric inequality generation via LP and convex hulls
- Heuristic filtering and aesthetic ranking
- Interactive exploration, export to Lean 4, and educational demos

Let your machine dream. Let it write mathematics.
