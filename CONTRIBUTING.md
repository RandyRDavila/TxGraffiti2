## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

* Search existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported.
* If not, open a new issue with:

  * A descriptive title.
  * Steps to reproduce.
  * Expected vs. actual behavior.
  * Environment information (`python --version`, OS).

### Suggesting Enhancements

* Use the issue tracker to propose new features or improvements.
* Clearly describe the use case and rationale.
* Provide examples or pseudocode if possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** in the appropriate module under `graffitiai/`.

3. **Add or update tests** in the `tests/` directory.

4. **Update documentation** if your change affects the public API or usage:

   * README.md
   * Quickstart examples
   * Documentation site (if applicable)

5. **Run the full test suite**:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

6. **Commit and push**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against the `main` branch:

   * Follow the PR template.
   * Provide context and link to any relevant issues.
   * Request a review from at least one maintainer.

## Testing

* All new features should include unit tests.
* Place tests in the `txgraffiti/module_name/tests/` directory, mirroring the module structure.
* Use **pytest** fixtures for setup/teardown.
* Ensure code coverage remains high; aim for > 90% on new code.

## Documentation

* Keep docstrings up to date in modules and public classes/functions.
* Update `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` as needed.
* For larger changes, consider adding examples under `examples/`.

## Releasing

* Only maintainers can publish to PyPI.
* Follow semantic versioning (SEMVER).
* Tag the release on GitHub and push tags:

  ```bash
  git tag vX.Y.Z
  git push upstream --tags
  ```
